## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to create an Invetory Management system in spanish that can be made in either a small computer or cheap laptop. One that has an inventory management system that is simple enought for anyone to understand how to use, but also offers benefits to anyone using it. In theory what I would like to do with a project like this is make it so that it does not need to be connnected to the internet to use, but instead offers a full fledge inventory system by itself. It would also be great to add functions like a report creator and be able to upload documents

There's a huge need right now around the world and in the United States for software made for spanish speakers by native spakers. I orginally thought about this idea as a project I could work on and give to my grandfather who is tech savvy, but still manages all his inventory view pen and paper. It is not because he doesn't know how to use computers, but software like this is too expensive for most people in Mexico. It seems that there is a lack of spanish speaking coders in mexico, which i have noticed is an issue all over the world. However, most computer programmers come to the United States to earn more, but that leaves a lot of people who are underserved to be well.. underserved. 
### Features
User Login-Manager: Users will be able to create users who can use the application with full access to all the features such as the following.
User Login-Employee: Users will be able to create users who can use the application, but without access to User Management
Inventory managment: The inventory system will hold data that is established by the users. They can create the name of the product and also how many are in stock. You can later access these values and make changes to them.
User Management: This feature allows the Manager to remove any ex employees or assign new ones.
and Possibly to Upload Documents in folders: I would love to have a way that someone can upload pictures dirrectly from their phone, that way they can have folders which old orders, or reciepts.
### Technologies
- MySQL
- Bootstrap
- MVC
### What I'll Have to Learn
- There's two different things that would be a great feature if learned:
1. Barcode Reader and assiging the data to a value
2. Uploading documents and how that would be read by the comptuer.
